  ## Challenges

  Suprisingly one of the biggest challenges was trying to type in the word "license" because I kept spelling it wrong. That being said, another issue I had was learning how to code the darn thing with node impromptu with very little practice before hand. Especially with mmodule exports I felt rather confused on if I needed to set it to the index file or not. However, I did manage to persevere thanks to my tutor who helped me improve in this area. Also I didn't know how to mkae images load into javascript-much less send the information from the assets folder into the Javascript file and all the assets it was just a mess.

  ## Solutions

  The first solution to the proper linking is that module.exports will load itself with the data as long as you connect it in the index file with require. Also my tutor helped me clean up my code to make it spiffy.
